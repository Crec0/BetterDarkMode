# Better Dark Mode
A small client side mod which fixes text color for custom named blocks when using dark mode resource pack or transparent.

## How to use
Download and install the mod client side. By default, it is set to make all inventory gui text white.
However, it can be changed using to black using `betterdarkmode black`.
To get back to white, `betterdarkmode white`.

## Thoughts
Custom static colors were added and then removed because I didn't feel most people will use it.
However, if you want me to add custom static colors feel free to make a feature request.
